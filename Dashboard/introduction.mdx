Nanoheal Management portal is one of the server components of the Nanoheal solution that allows its users to view information related to the devices being managed as well as provide the users a single pane of glass to manage various features, policies and configurations for the connected devices.

Nanoheal’s Management Portal can be accessed using the URL set for an organization’s server instance.

A typical Management Portal URL would look like: 
https://democc.Nanoheal.com/Dashboard/

Some organizations may also want to white label the Management Portal URL and use their corporate domain name instead of *.Nanoheal.com.

In those cases, the Management Portal URL may look like:
https://dashboard.self-heal.acme.com/Dashboard/
