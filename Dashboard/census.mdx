##Expunge a device
All the details regarding to a client can be removed from the Dashboard by expunging it. 
To expunge, click on the expunge link next to the device. You will be asked if you only want to Expunge the device, or remove other details linked to it. (NOTE we can not expunge a device if Nanoheal installed and active)
