Nanoheal’s Management portal provides an array of automations that can be used to fix the issues that were reported by the connected devices.
To execute an issue resolution:
1.	Navigate to the module via the side menu.
2.	Click on Change(?) and open the side pane to see the List of machines/groups
3.	Select the device that you want to fix the issue on.
4.	The resolution tiles will be updated based on the device you have selected.
Note: By design, toolkit will show the fixes that are available all the machines which belong to the default site, or the site/device that has been sleeted before Navigating to the module.
5.	Choose the high-level issue description from the left-hand side of the page.
6regr.	Select a specific issue from the list on the right-hand side of the page and click on ‘Run this repair’.
 
Note: If the device is online the automation would be executed in Realtime. If not, it would be executed the next time device comes online.
