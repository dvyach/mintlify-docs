    2. Executed.
    3. Both Deployed & Executed.
4. If your software has separate 32- and 64-bit packages, you must configure them separately.

    ### Configure Deploy
    Click on the 32 bits / 64-bit configuration for Deploy and enter the following details:
1. Enable the function by setting entering 1 on enable and 0 for disable. This value is set to 1 by default.
2. The FTP/ CDN URL path would be prefilled based on the configurations set.

Once you have configured the Execute/Deploy configurations, you can also set configurations to
