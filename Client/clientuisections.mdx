  ## Below are 6 different sections of Nanoheal client UI,
    ### 1. Welcome Page
    As you open the Nanoheal client, Welcome page will be  displayed  as  shown  in  the  below figure. There are multiple options on this page. You can click on the 'Click to Troubleshoot', button on the page to access the trouble-shooters page. You can also click on the burger menu on top to explore other functions. To come back to welcome page, at any time, click on home button on the top-left of the client to come back to this page. There are two images below

Please see the button on top-left is context sensitive. It changes to back button when you travel more than one sections and you can trace the history back.    
    ### 2. Troubleshooter’s Page
    Troubleshooters page list all the automations that are available for end-user to execute. There are 2 ways to navigate to Troubleshooter’s page:
      1.	On the Welcome page, click on the “Click to Troubleshoot”, button to access the Troubleshooters page.
      2.	From anywhere in the Nanoheal client, you can click on top right burger icon and click on the Troubleshooters option to open this page.

Please refer to the 2 images below to see the troubleshooters page and the second  way  to navigate to the troubleshooter’s page.

On the left hand, it displays all the categories of automations  that  are  available  for  end  user  to execute. User can navigate to relevant category and look for the  required  automations  / troubleshooters. Click on one of the items from the list on the left to see the corresponding executable automations and tile descriptions. The automation / solution will be accompanied by “Execute” button. If the execute button is not displayed, then that would mean, it is sub-category and can further be expanded. Below 2 images show both type of pages:
    1.	By clicking on a category on left hand panel, you see the automations / troubleshooters on the right side
    2.	By clicking on a category on left hand panel, you see sub-categories on the right side. By clicking on the plus button in the sub-category, the automation list is opened up

    ### 3. Search function on Troubleshooter’s page
    As the solution list can be long enough, there is a search function given on the left  hand side.  This can be used to search any particular automation. Search works efficiently to search for relevant search results within title and description. It can look for words in categories, sub-categories, automation title and automation descriptions. Below are the screenshots that explains few of the search scenarios:
        1.	Search for a key word and it filters the results on the left side of client
        2.	Search for a phrase and it filters the results on the left side of client

The results displayed are clickable. As you click on any of the result that you feel is relevant, it will display the same on the righthand side.
